Combat-
Move Round: Based on movement speed. Slowest moves first (tied speed, lowest Dex, then lowest Wisdom)
and declares intended action. Move to next slowest, etc. If choose not to move, 
you can declare two actions, but both actions suffer a -2 penalty to speed.
(Does not apply to forced immobilization)

Action Round: Declared actions resolve in order of fastest to slowest: action speed + character DEX.
Each type of action has a different speed (1=slowest). Certain weapons are faster than others,
certain spells are quicker to cast, and different maneuvers take different times.\

--Maneuvers: 
-Dodge (1/2 damage + defender can move 1/2 movement speed) [5 speed]
	Attacker and Defender roll 1d10+DEX. If attacker wins, deals full damage and defender doesn't move.
-Parry (0 damage) [6 speed]
	Req. Must be wielding a weapon or shield. 
	If character is attacked with a melee weapon after this Parry is resolved, the Attacker and Defender make a dex challenge 1d10+dex. There is no To Hit roll needed. 
	Attacker wins = no reduction for defender str in damage roll. This only applies to one melee attack. If you use two Parry maneuvers, the second will be applied to the second melee attack that resolves against you.
-Grapple (restrain opponent), [4 speed] 
	Str challenge. If grappler wins, defender loses next action, must use a declared action of speed 5 to break with STR check. 
	The grappler cannot take any declared actions while grappling, but may choose to drop the grapple during the Move phase.
	If defender wins, continues as normal
-Topple (knock prone), [4 speed]
	STR challenge. Grappler wins, defender falls prone, takes move to stand.
-Aim (next attack extra damage, more accurate), [5 speed]
	If you attack with a weapon on next intended action, add +3 to hit and deal +3 damage.
-Jump/Leap, [5 speed]
-Interact [DM determines; 6 easy use - 1 very hard/slow to use]



To Hit: DEX + 1d10 > Armor Value
Damage: Weapon Die + Attacker STR - 1/2 Defender STR
