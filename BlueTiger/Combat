Combat-
Move Round: Based on movement speed. Slowest moves first (tied speed, lowest Dex)
and declares intended action. Move to next slowest, etc. If choose not to move, 
can declare two actions. These actions resolve together at their combined total speed.
(Does not apply to forced immobilization)

Action Round: Declared actions resolve in order of action speed, fastest to slowest.
Each type of action has a different speed. Certain weapons are faster than others,
certain spells are quicker to cast, and different maneuvers take different times.\

--Maneuvers: 
-Dodge (1/2 damage + move 1/2 speed) [1 speed]
	Attacker and Defender roll 1d10+DEX. If attacker wins, deals full damage and defender doesn't move.
-Parry (0 damage) [0 speed]
	Attacker and Defender dex challenge 1d10+dex. Attacker wins=full damage and no reduction for def str. 
-Grapple (restrain opponent), [2 speed] 
	Str challenge. If grappler wins, defender loses next action, must use turn to break with STR check. If defender wins, continues as normal
-Topple (knock prone), [2 speed]
	STR challenge. Grappler wins, defender falls prone, takes move to stand.
-Aim (next attack extra damage, more accurate), [1 speed]
