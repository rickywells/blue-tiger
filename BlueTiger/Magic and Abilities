Magic--
Spells have a base mage point cost. You can adapt parts of the spell for additional
cost, ie. increase the range by 10 feet with 1 point, increase damage by spending
points, number of targets, etc. 
Spells may have requirements based on skill or specialization or level. It may also 
have restrictions on number of mage points spent, or frequency of use.
