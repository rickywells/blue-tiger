Armor
Static defensive values, 6-12
Light Leather -> 6
Heavy Leather -> 7
Light Chain -> 8
Scale -> 9
Half-Plate -> 10
Heavy Chain -> 11
Steel Plate -> 12

OPTIONAL: Durability points. Armor has a durability rating equal to its defensive value times 5. When a wearer of the armor takes a total
amount of damage equal to that rating, the defensive value decreases by 1, and any extra points of durability damage roll over to the new value.
Armor can be repaired back to full effectiveness.
